[Intro]
(single strum B, Ebm, Db.)
 
B                      Ebm          Db
Is that the old man walking in the dark  x4
 
B                      Ebm          Db
Take me home where them broken brights
Are shinning down, make me feel alright
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

B                      Ebm          Db
Is that the old man walking in the dark
Is that the old man walking in the dark
 
B                      Ebm          Db
Shake them bones let me lost tonight
We'll grow young make me feel alright
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

B                       Ebm          Db
Is that the old man walking in the dark
