[Lyrics]
A#m               C#
Billy was a train, driving man
He went from one side to the other side of town
He went to bed with the light on
He went to bed with the light on
 
Ride on
 
He found his struggle with the wind
Something we never, came to understand
He felt lost, in the dark
Even when there was someone, he felt apart
 
Alone
Alone
Alone
 
D#m            F#
Cause in the, dark
    A#m           C#
There's monsters, they cry alone
D#m              F#
They're waiting
A#m                     C#
For you to come along, and play
A#m                     C#
For you to come along, and play
 
He made his way to the liquor store
couldn't help but notice, the man at the door
Yeah he did, he caught his eye
He said sir, please a nickel, before I die
 
Alone
Alone
Alone
 
Cause in the, dark
There's monsters, they cry alone
They're waiting
For you to come along, and play
For you to come along, and play
And play
For you to come along, and play
And play
 
Cause in the, the dark
There's monsters, they cry alone
They're waiting
For you to come along, and play
 
Cause were monsters at heart
At heart, at heart
There's monsters, in their hearts
Their hearts
 
For you to come along and play
And play
For you to come along
And play
 
Billy was a train driving man
He got lost, some place in the wind
